A class largely taught in C which serves as an introduction to how digital computers are built and the process by which computer programs expressed in a high-level language are translated into signals to be routed on a digital circuit board. I held weekly office hours and led optional lab sessions.  Course description available [here](http://catalog.davidson.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=26&poid=1681#tt3194).
