I currently work as a Product Manager at JPMorgan Chase, where I apply my technical expertise to drive the team responsible for the Consumer and Community Banking data streaming platform.  

I am passionate about the intersection of finance and technology.  

Before working at Chase, I received my BS in Computer Science and Political Science from Davidson College and my MS in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  I have enjoyed interning for both Apple (2022) and Amazon (2021), as well as consulting for Test Innovators as a data scientist (2020-2023).
